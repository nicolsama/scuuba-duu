  - Users can receive points during their dives. 
  - Users can log their score.

## Architecture and Technology
  - Javascript for game logic
  - HTML5 Canvas for rendering game
  - Firebase DB for persisting high scores
  - Webpack for bundling files
## Implementation Timeline
  - Set up basic skeleton (4.26.20)
  - Draw basic canvas shapes for each component, work on rendering intervals for randomized bubbles / sand dollars / sharks (4.27.20)
  - Begin core game logic ( Stare game, air tank meter levels, point accruing & game over. Set up database for persisting highscores.  (4.28.20)
  - Continue game logic and rendering details. Add links, how to play/controls (4.29.20)
## Bonus Features
  - Points for dive style (addtl controls, think ski free)
